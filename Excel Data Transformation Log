Data exploration, cleaning, and transformation
•	Opened 202301-divvy-tripdata
•	Removed duplicates
•	Trimmed data contained in each column
•	Sorted sheet based on started_at column, from least to most recent
•	Formatted columns H and J as text
•	Formatted columns K, L, M, and N as decimal numbers
•	Created trip_duration column (column E)
•	Calculated trip_duration
•	Created day_of_week column (column F)
•	Calculated day_of_week
•	Added filters
•	Checked for inconsistent values in each column (null values found in columns G, H, I, and J, also there are more than 3,000 rows with a trip duration of 0 and a few rows with negative values)
•	Filtered for negative values (the values in the ended_at column seem to be less than the values in the started_at column)
•	Inverted the values in the started_at and ended_at columns only for the respective rows containing negative values in the trip_duration column
•	Updated the trip_duration formula
•	Removed filters
•	These steps were repeated for the rest of the tables respective to each remaining month (no new steps performed since the data in the other tables contained similar errors)
•	Conducted a descriptive statistics analysis on the trip_duration and day_of_week columns for each month
•	Calculated the average trip duration per day of week for members and casual riders for each month using a pivot table
•	Calculated the average rides per day of week for members and casual riders for each month using a pivot table
•	Calculated the amount of each bike type used by members and casual riders for each month using a pivot table
