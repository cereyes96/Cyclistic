# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
## Cyclistic Case Study

### Introduction
In this case study, I performed an in depth analysis for the fictional bike share company, Cyclistis, in order to provide insights for the business task assigned. During the process, I was able to put into practice everything I learned during the course and have a better understanding of the 6 steps of the data analysis process, which are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

### Background
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

### Analysis
I was assigned the following question to answer with the analysis: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Also, I was tasked to produce a report with the following deliverables:
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of my analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. My top three recommendations based on my analysis
