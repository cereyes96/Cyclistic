# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
### Cyclistic Case Study

## Introduction
In this case study, I performed an in depth analysis for the fictional bike share company, Cyclistis, in order to provide insights for the business task assigned. During the process, I was able to put into practice everything I learned during the course and have a better understanding of the 6 steps of the data analysis process, which are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
