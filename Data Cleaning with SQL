-- First, let's count the number of rows of the table we created

SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM

-- The result is 5,719,877 rows

-- Now, let's proceed to the data cleaning step. Based on the initial exploration and analysis performed on each individual table using Microsoft Excel, we know that there are numerous null values, as well as some inconsistent ones.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS my-project-19297-401423.case_study_cyclist.divvy_tripdata_2023_cleaned;

--Here we are going to create a new table for the cleaned data

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS my-project-19297-401423.case_study_cyclist.divvy_tripdata_2023_cleaned AS (

--Next, we have to set ride_id as a primary key
ALTER TABLE my-project-19297-401423.case_study_cyclist.divvy_tripdata_2023_cleaned
ADD PRIMARY KEY(ride_id) NOT ENFORCED;

--Lastly, lets count the rows of our new clean table

SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS number_of_rows
FROM
  my-project-19297-401423.case_study_cyclist.divvy_tripdata_2023_cleaned

--The result is 4,243,432 rows. Meaning 1,476,445 rows were deleted.
